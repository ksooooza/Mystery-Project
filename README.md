# MYSTERY PROJECT - MERN Front End

## I built my MERN front end project off of Ari's Met Art Museum API. It has full CRUD implemented, as well as a Nav bar and a Modal UI on the homepage with some select information about each piece of art.

I would have liked to have had more time to make it look better, but such is.
